To launch the whole app from the dev environment:

Open the project in VS Code and start the dev container.

Once inside the dev container, you can use the integrated terminal to start all services:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up



This command will start all services (backend, frontend, mlflow, and prefect) using the development configuration.

You can now access:

- Backend API at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend Dash app at http://localhost:8050
- MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000
- Prefect UI at http://localhost:4200

You'll be able to edit any component (backend, frontend, mlflow, or prefect) within the VS Code environment, and the changes will be reflected in the running services due to the volume mounts and development commands used.

Certainly! Here's a readme_infra.md file that explains the entire setup, tailored for a junior developer and diving into the underlying technologies and Dockerfile details:

# Aleph Infrastructure Setup

## Overview

Aleph is a chemical process optimization system built with a microservices architecture. This document explains the infrastructure setup, which uses Docker and Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services.

## Infrstructure Components

1. Backend (FastAPI)
2. Frontend (Dash)
3. MLflow
4. Prefect

## Technology Stack

- **Docker**: Containerization platform
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container Docker application orchestrator
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Poetry**: Dependency management for Python
- **FastAPI**: Backend web framework
- **Dash**: Frontend framework for building analytical web applications
- **MLflow**: Platform for the machine learning lifecycle
- **Prefect**: Workflow management system

## Dockerfile Explanations

### Backend Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install poetry
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false \
    && poetry install --no-dev --no-interaction --no-ansi
COPY src/ ./src/
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```
This Dockerfile:
- Uses a slim Python 3.9 image as the base
- Installs Poetry for dependency management
- Copies and installs project dependencies
- Copies the application source code
- Sets the command to run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn

### Frontend Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install poetry
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false \
    && poetry install --no-dev --no-interaction --no-ansi
COPY src/ ./src/
CMD ["python", "src/app.py"]
```
This Dockerfile is similar to the backend but runs the Dash application instead.

### MLflow and Prefect Dockerfiles
These Dockerfiles are simpler, just installing the respective tools and setting the appropriate command to run the servers.

### Docker Compose
We use two Docker Compose files:
- `docker-compose.yml`: Main configuration for production
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`: Overrides for development

#### docker-compose.yml
This file defines the services, their build contexts, and the connections between them. It sets up volumes for persistent data storage.

#### docker-compose.dev.yml
This file extends the main compose file for development purposes. It:
- Mounts local directories into the containers for live code reloading
- Exposes additional ports for debugging
- Sets commands for running services in development mode

### Development Container
The .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file configures a development environment in Visual Studio Code. It:
- Sets up a consistent development environment
- Installs necessary VS Code extensions
- Mounts the project directory
- Installs dependencies for all services

#### How to Use
- Production: Run `docker-compose up --build`
- Development: Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

In development mode, you can edit the code on your local machine, and the changes will be reflected in the running containers.

### Networking
In the Docker Compose setup, each service can refer to others by their service name. For example, the backend can reach the MLflow server at http://mlflow:5000.

### Volumes
Docker volumes are used to persist data for MLflow and Prefect. This ensures that data is not lost when containers are restarted.

### Environment Variables
The .env file contains environment variables used by the services. This is where you would put configuration and secrets.

### Scaling and Future Considerations
This setup allows for easy scaling of individual services. In the future, I might consider:
- Using Kubernetes for more advanced orchestration
- Implementing a reverse proxy (like Nginx) for better request routing
- Setting up monitoring and logging services
